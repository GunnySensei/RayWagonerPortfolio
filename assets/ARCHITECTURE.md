# Architecture — Raymond Wagoner, PhD Candidacy Portfolio

## 1. Overview

A static, informational portfolio web app. No auth, no database, no user accounts, no server-side logic — the entire "backend" is a folder of artifact files (PDFs, PowerPoint decks, etc.) served as static files. The app is a client-rendered React SPA that presents a home page, an about page, a competency-hub grid, six competency detail pages (each listing CACREP competency statements plus the supporting artifacts that satisfy them), and a contact page.

Hosting target is intentionally undecided (domain TBD, may run purely locally for now). The architecture is written to be **host-agnostic**: the build output is a static `dist/` folder that runs identically via `vite preview` on a laptop, a plain nginx box, or any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, S3, etc.) once a domain is chosen. Nothing in the app depends on where it's deployed.

## 2. Tech Stack

Adopted as specified:

| Layer | Library | Version |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | React | 18.x |
| Language | TypeScript | 5.x |
| Bundler | Vite | 5.x |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | 4.x |
| Class merging | clsx + tailwind-merge | — |
| Server state | React Query | 5.x |
| Charts | Tremor | 3.x |
| UI primitives | shadcn/ui | — |
| Radix UI | @radix-ui/* | latest |
| Variant styling | class-variance-authority | 0.7.x |

**One addition, not in the source table:** `react-router-dom` — required for a multi-page site (Home / About / Portfolio hub / 6 competency pages / Contact) to have real, linkable, bookmarkable URLs. Flagging it explicitly since it wasn't in the original list.

**Fit notes for this specific project:**
- **React Query** has no real job on day one — there's no API, and content is static. Rather than pre-installing it as unused dead weight, **defer `npm install` until there's an actual async data source** (e.g., if artifact files move to a CMS or object-storage listing endpoint later). Don't invent a fetch layer just to use it, and don't add the dependency before that need exists.
- **Tremor** (charts) likewise has nothing to chart yet — same call: **don't install it at scaffold time.** If a real need shows up later (a CV timeline, a publication-count chart on the Research page), add it then. Keeping both out of `package.json` until they're load-bearing keeps the dependency tree honest about what the site actually uses.
- **shadcn/ui + Radix + CVA + clsx/tailwind-merge** are the actual workhorses here — they cover Button (outlined/filled variants from `DESIGN.md`), Card, NavigationMenu, and Badge, which is nearly the full component inventory this site needs.

## 4. Content Model

All page copy and the artifact manifest live in one typed source of truth (`src/content/competencies.ts`), not scattered across JSX. The hub page maps over it to render cards; the detail page looks up one entry by route slug and renders its content in whichever of the three layouts (see `DESIGN.md` §4, "Competency Detail Page") that competency uses.

All six competency RTFs have now been read in full and converted to markdown (`assets/PhD Portfolio/*/PDFs for Web */*.md`, one per competency, gitignored alongside their source folder — see §5). That confirms the shape needed, and surfaced one structural fact that changes the model from what was originally assumed: **Professional Identity isn't a variant of the artifact-based pages — it has no CACREP competency letters at all**, and needs a third, differently-shaped content type. The other five findings refine the `Artifact` shape:
- An artifact's title is freeform text, often carrying a course-code prefix (`"710 CoLeadership Reflection"`)
- The competencies an artifact satisfies are expressed as letter ranges/lists (`"A, B, C"`, `"A-G"`, `"A - D, F - H"`) and should be normalized to an expanded `string[]` of letters at authoring time, not stored as raw range text — that's what makes "show everything that satisfies competency H" possible later. **This mapping is optional** — a real "Teaching Experience" entry has no Meets line at all, not even an empty one.
- An artifact can have **zero, one, or many** associated list items (the raw manifest includes entries like `"Teaching Internship COUC 970, 14-week online course (Fall 2025) (no file)"` — a real experience entry with nothing to link)
- **Individual list items can themselves lack a file**, independent of the artifact-level zero/one/many count — two real items ("Three semesters of adjunct teaching…", "Three semesters of Faculty teaching…" on the Teaching page) are plain informational text with no document and no "(no file)" annotation either. So `filename` is optional per item, not just the array being possibly empty.
- Files are not all PDFs — the manifest includes at least one `_ppt`/PowerPoint file and one `.jpeg` (a photographed license) alongside PDFs, so the content model and hosting strategy must be file-type-agnostic, not "pdf-only"
- **Every competency's CACREP letter list is genuinely distinct** (different letters, different count, different wording) — there is no shared A–M set to reuse across pages; each `Competency.competencyItems` array must be authored per page from its own RTF

```ts
// src/types/content.ts
interface ArtifactFile {
  label: string;        // display name, e.g. "710 CoLeadership Reflection"
  filename?: string;     // e.g. "710-coleadership-reflection.pdf" — absent for plain-text/no-file list items
}

interface Artifact {
  title: string;              // e.g. "Group Counseling Course Leadership Reflection"
  meets?: string[];            // expanded competency letters, e.g. ["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","J","L"] — absent for background/experience entries with no competency mapping
  description?: string;        // short description; may be absent for raw "experience" entries
  files: ArtifactFile[];       // 0, 1, or many; entries may themselves lack `filename` (plain text, no document)
}

// Professional Identity's shape — no CACREP letters, grouped by requirement category instead
type EvidenceItem =
  | { kind: 'file'; label: string; filename: string }
  | { kind: 'citation'; text: string }        // e.g. an in-progress manuscript reference, no document
  | { kind: 'note'; text: string };            // e.g. "(No file — just space to write my attendance)"

interface RequirementGroup {
  heading: string;              // e.g. "Membership in Professional Counseling Organizations"
  items: EvidenceItem[];
}

interface CompetencyBase {
  slug: string;                 // e.g. "teaching" — also the /public/artifacts subfolder name (matches source Wix folder name, kebab-cased)
  navLabel: string;              // "Teaching Competency"
  cardTitle: string;             // "Teaching Competency Portfolio"
  cardDescription: string;       // hub-card one-liner
}

type Competency =
  | (CompetencyBase & {
      artifactLayout: 'list' | 'row';
      categoryLabel: string;       // "CACREP Doctoral Competencies (2024)"
      competencyItems: string[];   // this page's own lettered statements — never shared across competencies
      artifacts: Artifact[];
    })
  | (CompetencyBase & {
      artifactLayout: 'category';
      requirementGroups: RequirementGroup[];
    });
```

Confirmed page → `artifactLayout` mapping (see `DESIGN.md` §4 for the full rationale table):

| slug | artifactLayout | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `teaching` | `'list'` | Several artifacts group 2–4 files each |
| `research-and-scholarship` | `'list'` | Two artifacts group 3 and 5 files respectively |
| `supervision` | `'list'` | Four of seven artifacts group multiple files |
| `counseling` | `'row'` | Every artifact maps to exactly one file |
| `leadership-and-advocacy` | `'row'` | Every one of 9 artifacts maps to exactly one file |
| `professional-identity` | `'category'` | No CACREP letters — organized by requirement category |

**A `'row'`-layout competency is expected to have exactly one file per artifact** — that's the pattern's whole premise (one "Access Artifact" button per row). If real content for a `'row'` page ever includes a multi-file artifact, that's a signal the page should be `'list'` layout instead, not a case to special-case around.

Adding a new artifact is: drop its file(s) in `public/artifacts/<slug>/`, add one `Artifact` (or `RequirementGroup`, for Professional Identity) entry to that competency's array. No component code changes required — the three layout components render whatever's in the data.

## 5. Artifact File Hosting Strategy

Source content is mixed file types (PDF, PowerPoint at minimum — the real Teaching manifest includes a `_ppt` file), not PDF-only, so the strategy is written generically as "artifact files."

- Files live in `public/artifacts/<competency-slug>/<filename>.<ext>`. Vite copies `public/` verbatim into the build root, so every file is served at `/artifacts/<slug>/<filename>.<ext>` — identical path locally (`vite preview`) and on whatever domain is eventually chosen. No CDN, storage bucket, or backend needed for v1.
- A single helper resolves URLs so nothing hardcodes the `/artifacts/` prefix in components:
  ```ts
  // src/lib/artifacts.ts
  export const artifactUrl = (slug: string, filename: string) => `/artifacts/${slug}/${filename}`;
  ```
- Links render as plain `<a href={artifactUrl(...)} target="_blank" rel="noopener">` — the browser (or OS, for non-PDF types like `.pptx`) handles display/download natively. No embedded viewer component for any file type; that's unnecessary complexity for "click to view/download."
- Keep filenames kebab-case with the original extension preserved, lowercase, to avoid URL-encoding surprises. Source filenames from the Wix export (e.g. `"710 CoLeadership Reflection.pdf"`, spaces and mixed case) will need a rename pass on import — `Artifact.files[].label` keeps the human-readable original name for display regardless of the sanitized `filename`.
- If Vite is ever deployed under a subpath (e.g. a GitHub Pages project page instead of a root domain), set `base` in `vite.config.ts` accordingly — `artifactUrl()` should build off `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` rather than a hardcoded `/artifacts/` root once that's known, so it isn't a rewrite later.
- **Repo size:** commit artifact files directly to the repo (simplest — no backend means the repo *is* the content store). If any individual file exceeds ~10MB, switch that file to Git LFS rather than letting the repo balloon; revisit this once real files are in hand.

### Content Import Process

The full delivery arrived as `assets/PhD Portfolio/` (git-ignored, personal/sensitive documents — see §5 and `.gitignore`), one subfolder per competency, each containing a `PDFs for Web <Competency>/` folder with the web-ready PDFs plus a `<Competency> Competencies.rtf` manifest. All six RTFs have been read and converted to markdown, co-located next to their source RTF (e.g. `assets/PhD Portfolio/Teaching/PDFs for Web Teaching/Teaching Competencies.md`) — those `.md` files are the authoritative transcription source for `content/competencies.ts`, not the raw RTFs, and each one carries its own conversion notes documenting file-count cross-checks and content gaps found.

Per-competency import steps (repeat for each of the six):
1. Rename/copy the actual artifact files from `PDFs for Web <Competency>/` into `public/artifacts/<slug>/` with sanitized filenames
2. Hand-transcribe the `.md` manifest's title / "Meets" / file-list structure into that competency's entry in `src/content/competencies.ts`, expanding any letter ranges (`"A-G"`) into full arrays (`["A","B","C","D","E","F","G"]`)
3. Set `artifactLayout` per the confirmed mapping table in §4 — this is a per-page decision made once, not per-artifact

This is a manual transcription step, not an automated RTF parser — six competencies with a few dozen artifacts each doesn't justify building a parser, and the raw manifest format isn't consistent enough (mixed "no file" annotations, inconsistent range notation, typos) to parse reliably without human judgment anyway.

**Content gaps found during conversion — resolved decisions:**
- **Counseling — "998 Case Conceptualization" (Meets A–F):** no web PDF exists, only a `.pptx` in the raw folder. **Decision: don't convert to PDF — copy the `.pptx` itself into `PDFs for Web Counseling/` and link to it directly**, same as any other artifact file. This matches the architecture's existing file-type-agnostic stance (§5): the link opens with `target="_blank"`, and the browser/OS decides whether to preview or download it — no embedded viewer is added just for this one file. Note the practical caveat: most browsers will download a `.pptx` rather than render it inline (unlike a PDF, which most browsers preview natively) — that's expected and consistent with "no embedded viewer for any file type," not a bug to fix.
- **Supervision — the "Supervision Reflection" title collision:** resolved by using the words already present in the underlying filenames rather than inventing new phrasing. The grouped artifact (covering `714 Initial Session Reflection` + `714 Second Session Reflection`) is titled **"Initial and Second Session Reflections"**; the unrelated single-file `710 Supervision Reflection` keeps its own title unchanged. Updated in `Supervision Competencies.md`.
- **Descriptions (Counseling, Leadership and Advocacy, Research and Scholarship, Supervision):** these four pages' RTFs give title + Meets + file(s) but no narrative description text (Teaching's descriptions exist only because they were authored directly in the Wix mockup, not captured in any RTF). **Decision: use a literal placeholder string for every missing description, to be replaced with real copy later** — not fabricated specifics about Ray's actual coursework. Use the exact text `"Description coming soon."` for every placeholder (same styling as a real description, no special muted/italic treatment — see `DESIGN.md` §4) so a future find-and-replace across `content/competencies.ts` can locate every unwritten one. This applies to the `Artifact.description` field only; Category Groups entries (Professional Identity) don't have a description field to placeholder.

**Still open — needs Ray's input before that page can ship complete:**
- **Professional Identity:** the "Curriculum Vitae" requirement category has no file at all in the delivered folder. Needs a CV PDF if the page is meant to link to one — not addressed yet.

## 6. Site Map & Routing

```
/                           Home — short intro + CTA into Portfolio
/about                      About Me — full bio, education history, headshot
/portfolio                  Portfolio Hub (6-card grid, links out to each competency)
├── /portfolio/teaching
├── /portfolio/supervision
├── /portfolio/research-and-scholarship
├── /portfolio/professional-identity
├── /portfolio/leadership-and-advocacy
└── /portfolio/counseling
/contact                    Contact
*                           404 / Not Found
```

| Path | Page |
|---|---|
| `/` | Home |
| `/about` | About Me |
| `/portfolio` | Portfolio hub (6 competency cards) |
| `/portfolio/:slug` | Competency detail (generic component + `content/competencies.ts` lookup) |
| `/contact` | Contact |
| `*` | Not Found — catch-all for unmatched paths, styled consistently with the rest of the site (not a bare browser error page) |

Client-side routing via `react-router-dom`, browser (history) router. A multi-page Vite build (separate `.html` entries per route) was considered as a simpler, more SEO-native alternative, but for ~10 pages sharing one nav/footer/layout, a single SPA build is easier to maintain and deploy as one unit. Revisit only if search-engine indexing of individual competency pages becomes a real requirement — at that point, a prerendering step (e.g. `vite-plugin-ssg`) is a smaller change than switching frameworks.

### Per-Route Document Title

Each route sets `document.title` on mount (a small `useDocumentTitle(title)` hook is enough — no need for a metadata library at this scale), formatted as `"{Page Title} — Raymond Wagoner, PhD Candidacy Portfolio"`. This is the one SEO/accessibility basic a static SPA needs to get right on its own, since there's no server to inject per-route `<title>`/meta tags at request time. A meta-description tag can follow the same pattern if search-result snippets matter later; not required for v1 given the primary audience (a graduate committee following direct links) doesn't depend on organic search discovery.

### Nav Structure — Hybrid Dropdown

The top-level nav bar shows exactly four items: **Home / About Me / Portfolio / Contact**. "Portfolio" is a dropdown (mega-menu) trigger, not a plain link — hovering/clicking it exposes all 6 competency links (Teaching, Supervision, Research and Scholarship, Professional Identity, Leadership and Advocacy, Counseling) without requiring a visit to `/portfolio` first. This was chosen over a flat 9-item nav (which the raw Wix mockup implied) to keep the nav bar uncluttered, and over a hub-only nav (no dropdown) to keep every competency one hover away rather than two clicks away.

Implementation: shadcn/ui's `NavigationMenu` (built on `@radix-ui/react-navigation-menu`, already in the stack) is the natural fit — it handles the dropdown/trigger/keyboard-nav mechanics; only the visual styling needs to follow `DESIGN.md`'s flat, square-corner system (see `DESIGN.md` §4 "Navigation" for the dropdown-panel spec).

## 7. Contact Page

No backend, so no custom form-handling server. Two options, pick one when building the page:
- **Simplest:** a `mailto:` link.
- **If a real in-page form is wanted:** point the form at a third-party static-form endpoint (e.g. Formspree, Web3Forms) — these accept a POST from a plain `<form>` with no server code and no auth, consistent with the "no backend" constraint.

## 8. Styling Integration

`assets/DESIGN.md` tokens map directly into `tailwind.config.ts` as theme extensions rather than living as inline hex values in components:

```ts
colors: {
  ink: '#142426',
  forest: '#2F5F48',
  'sage-label': '#638673',
  'card-sage': '#BDD7D4',
  canvas: '#FFFDF7',
},
fontFamily: {
  serif: ['Fraunces', 'Georgia', 'serif'],
  sans: ['"Wix Madefor Text"', '-apple-system', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial', 'sans-serif'],
},
borderRadius: {
  DEFAULT: '0px', // square corners is the system's signature — see DESIGN.md §5
}
```

shadcn/ui components default to rounded corners and a neutral gray palette — both need overriding at the theme level (not per-component) so every generated primitive inherits square corners and the five-color palette automatically.

## 9. Build & Deploy

- `npm run dev` — local Vite dev server
- `npm run build` — static output to `dist/`
- `npm run preview` — serve the production build locally
- `npm run deploy` — `npm run build && wrangler deploy`, for a manual/local deploy outside the git-triggered flow
- No environment secrets required beyond an optional `VITE_CONTACT_FORM_ENDPOINT` if a third-party form service is used

**Hosting: Cloudflare Workers (static assets), domain via Cloudflare Registrar.** Cloudflare's dashboard currently funnels new "Workers & Pages" projects into the unified **Workers** flow rather than the classic Pages product — this deploys via Wrangler, not a plain build-output handoff, so the repo needs a `wrangler.jsonc`:
```jsonc
{
  "name": "ray-wagoner-portfolio",
  "compatibility_date": "2026-07-15",
  "assets": {
    "directory": "./dist",
    "not_found_handling": "single-page-application"
  }
}
```
`assets.directory` points at the Vite build output; no `main` worker script is needed since this is assets-only (no server-side Worker code — consistent with the "no backend" architecture). `not_found_handling: "single-page-application"` is what makes client-side routing (`react-router-dom`) work at the edge — without it, direct navigation or a refresh on any non-root route (e.g. `/portfolio/teaching`, which has no literal `dist/portfolio/teaching/index.html`) would 404. This replaced an earlier `public/_redirects` file (the classic-Pages convention for the same problem), removed once the project turned out to be Workers-based instead.

Connected directly to the GitHub repo (`GunnySensei/RayWagonerPortfolio`) via Cloudflare's Git integration — every push to `main` runs `npm run build` then `npx wrangler deploy` and publishes automatically; every other branch/PR gets its own preview deployment. Free tier comfortably covers this site. Domain attaches under the Worker's custom domains settings — trivial since the domain and the Worker live in the same Cloudflare account, so DNS self-configures. Worker names must be lowercase with hyphens (no uppercase, no underscores) — `ray-wagoner-portfolio`, not `RayWagonerPortfolio`.

## 10. Explicit Non-Goals

- No authentication, no user accounts, no sessions
- No database — content lives in versioned TypeScript/artifact-file pairs
- No server-side rendering for v1 — a client-rendered SPA is sufficient for a personal portfolio; SSG/prerendering is a future option, not a current requirement
- No CMS — adding/editing content means editing `src/content/competencies.ts` and committing artifact files, which is appropriate at this scale (one author, infrequent updates)

## 11. Open Decisions (deferred, not blocking)

- ~~Final hosting domain/provider~~ — resolved: Cloudflare Workers (static assets) + Cloudflare Registrar (see §9). Domain name itself still TBD.
- Whether the Contact page uses a bare `mailto:` or a third-party form endpoint
- Whether individual artifact files will need Git LFS (depends on actual file sizes once gathered) — currently 35MB total across 78 files, none over 10MB, so not needed yet
